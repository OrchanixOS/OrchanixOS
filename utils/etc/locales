# This file contains the list of supported locales for OrchanixOS. It will be
# automatically generated from the "localedata/SUPPORTED" file in the source
# distribution for Glibc.
#
# Uncomment any locales you need and run 'mklocales' to (re)generate them.
# 'en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8' is uncommented and enabled by default. You may also need
# to set which locale is the default via the /etc/locale.conf file and/or with
# the localectl(1) command.
#
# The OrchanixOS Installation Program will do all this automatically. Only do it
# manually if you need to change the locales for some reason.

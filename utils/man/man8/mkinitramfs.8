.SH NAME
.PP
mkinitramfs - Generate or regenerate an initramfs.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]mkinitramfs\f[R] [\f[I]kernel_version\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]mkinitramfs\f[R] is a wrapper around dracut(8) used to easily (re)generate an initramfs.

The initramfs is a small compressed filesystem containing the modules and drivers needed to mount the root filesystem, which is loaded by the bootloader immediately after the kernel.

\f[B]mkinitramfs\f[R] will generate or regenerate an initramfs using dracut(8). The output image will be written to /boot/initramfs-<kernel_version>.img (any existing initramfs will be automatically overwritten).

If no argument is passed, \f[B]mkinitramfs\f[R] will try to generate for the currently booted kernel. In some situations such as a chroot environment, this may fail. Therefore, the target kernel version can also be passed as an argument to \f[B]mkinitramfs\f[R].

NOTE: If you are generating the first initramfs for a newly installed kernel, you may subsequently need to update the bootloader configuration file using grub-mkconfig(8).
.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
\f[B]mkinitramfs\f[R] will exit with 0 for success and >0 for failure.

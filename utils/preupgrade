IMPORTANT: This upgrade includes a newer version of the core C library (glibc).
Upgrading on a running system using this utility will break your system, and is
therefore not possible. To upgrade, please boot a OrchanixOS live environment, run
the installation program, and choose 'Repair' --> 'Refresh'. This won't erase
your apps or data. For information on how to do this, see the following URL:
